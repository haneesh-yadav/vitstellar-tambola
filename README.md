## 🔌 Deploying for an Event

### Option A: Local Network (Recommended for indoor events)

1. Start the server on a laptop connected to the event WiFi
2. Find your laptop's local IP: `ipconfig` (Windows) or `ifconfig` (Mac/Linux)
3. Set environment variable: `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=http://YOUR_IP:3001`
4. Build the client: `cd client && npm run build`
5. Serve the build folder or set up Express to serve static files
6. Share `http://YOUR_IP:3000` with players

### Option B: Cloud Deployment

**Server** (e.g., Railway, Render, Fly.io):
```bash
cd server && npm start
```
Set `PORT` environment variable as needed.

**Client** (e.g., Vercel, Netlify):
```bash
cd client
REACT_APP_SERVER_URL=https://your-server-url.com npm run build
```
Deploy the `build/` folder.

### Environment Variables

| Variable | Default | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `PORT` | `3001` | Server port |
| `REACT_APP_SERVER_URL` | `http://localhost:3001` | Server URL for client |
